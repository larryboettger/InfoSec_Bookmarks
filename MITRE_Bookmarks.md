# MITRE Bookmarks

Whether you're on the offensive or defensive side of cyber (or somewhere in between) it's important to have an understanding of the tactics, techniques & procedures (TTPs) that threat actors use. The MITRE ATT&CK framework is a great resource for learning & staying up-to-date on attacker methods. 

Here are some MITRE ATT&CK bookmarks that I use:

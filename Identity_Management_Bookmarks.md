# Identity Management Bookmarks

Identity management is a critical component for an optimized cybersecurity program. It can be a challenge to implement due to:
* Not having an inventory of all of the identities,
*  Not knowing where all of the identities are used,
* Not having enough personnel resources to manage identities,
* Reactive & inconsistent provisioning/deprovisioning practices,
* Not spending enough time in the discovery phase to learn the business needs & technology stack when trying to automate with identity management solutions,
* Not building an adequate project plan that has tasks that are needed, resources identified & realistic milestones to ensure success,
* Not beginning with the end in mind when implementing identity management controls (how to transition from project to operations):
    - Defining KPIs to manage effectiveness, 
    - Maintaining adequate headcount for administrating automated solutions, 
    - Budgeting (licensing costs, for example), 
    - Maintain identity controls playbooks so all people in the process know their roles & responsibilities & can execute their assigned tasks in a repeatable manner regardless if it's the primary subject matter expert (SME) or their backup SMEs doing the work.
I help organizations design & implement IAM/IGA/PAM solutions (Okta, SailPoint, Thycotic/Delinea, etc.) and write procedures so that identity management practices can be effective, repeatable & manageable. 

Here are some resources that I've used as guides when helping clients with their identity management initiatives:

# **Cybersecurity Threat Modeling Bookmarks**

One of the questions that I ask when I'm talking to an organization's SDLC SMEs that develop technology or provide critical infrastructure services that impact our health & safety - "Can you please give me the output/lessons learned reports from your most recent threat modeling exercises?" If they can't produce it or if it is not adequate (see bookmarks below for examples of adequate), they don't need to wait for my final assessment report to take action.

If time isn't invested by the people that are responsible for protecting the consumer on thinking about what can go wrong with technology & practices; and implementing controls to prevent or mitigate the impact when it does, it can be assured that the threat actors are taking the time to do so.

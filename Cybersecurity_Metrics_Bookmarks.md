# Cybersecurity Metrics

I'm almost always talking to clients about how they can implement, maintain & measure the progress of their cyber program so they don't have the same cyber risks found year after year. 

Here are some starting metrics and a link to resources that I used to compile the lists:

* [CIS Controls V7 Measures & Metrics](https://www.cisecurity.org/insights/white-papers/cis-controls-v7-measures-metrics)
* [The Continuous Audit Metrics Catalog | CSA](https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/artifacts/the-continuous-audit-metrics-catalog)
* [Cyber Resiliency Metrics, Measures of Effectiveness, and Scoring | MITRE](https://www.mitre.org/news-insights/publication/cyber-resiliency-metrics-measures-effectiveness-and-scoring)
* [The Insider Threat Metrics You Need to Justify Your Insider Threat Program | Proofpoint US](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/insider-threat-management/insider-threat-metrics-you-need-justify-your-insider-threat-program)

* List of Cyber Metrics:

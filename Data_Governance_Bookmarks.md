# Questions to Ask Data Discovery Solution Vendors

Data discovery is an important step in protecting sensitive data where it is stored,
processed and transmitted (You cannot protect what you don't know about). The
process involves both manual and automated collection activities. Sometimes
organizations have a misconception that an automated data discovery tool will find all
the data. This is not always the case because the data discovery scanning application
does not have:
* All the information to find the data, such as in SaaS applications or systems on
unknown networks
* Adequate credentials and permissions to access the data
* All the regex patterns or data dictionaries necessary to find both structured and
unstructured data

Basic questions to ask data discovery solution vendors before investing in them:
* What methodology is used to find both structured and unstructured data
* Do they have templates (data dictionaries, regex patterns, etc.) to find structured
and unstructured data specific to your industry or regulation (PCI, CMMC, HIPAA,
etc.)?
* Will they allow you to conduct a full trial?
